*UPDATE:* I am working on something new related to data and machine learning. If you are a scientist or engineer who wants to improve deep learning models by intervening on training data, please get in touch. 

My primary research interest is furthering the science of deep learning—developing and conducting rigorous, empirical experiments to better understand deep learning systems—and using the resulting insights to improve the performance, efficiency, and human-interpretability of these systems. I used to pursue these interests as the Head of Data Research at [MosaicML](https://www.mosaicml.com/).

I also spent 1.5 years as an AI Resident at [FAIR](https://ai.facebook.com/), where I applied empirical approaches to understand deep learning systems under the supervision of [Ari Morcos](http://www.arimorcos.com/) and [Sergey Edunov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5w7uYrIAAAAJ&hl=en). The [publications](https://mleavitt.net/publications/) section of my site has summaries of all my work.

For my doctorate I studied the neurobiology of cognition at McGill University in Montréal with Julio Martinez-Trujillo. A friend once described my work as "translating weak electrical discharges in the brain into strong scientific statements about the mind".

[comment]: <> (One traditional way of investigating brain function is by [recording the electrical activity of single neurons]&#40;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-unit_recording&#41; while a research subject engages in a specific behavior. Recent technological advances have expanded on this model, making it possible to record the activity of large groups of neurons simultaneously. This advancement provides novel opportunities for understanding how entire networks of neurons coordinate to enact complex cognitive behavior.)

[comment]: <> (While these sophisticated techniques give researchers greater insight, they also present new challenges during the analysis of substantial quantities of complex, high-dimensional data. I pursued these opportunities during my PhD in the lab of [Dr. Julio Martinez-Trujillo]&#40;http://martinezlab.robarts.ca/&#41;, studying how networks of neurons coordinate to give rise to behaviors such as [working memory]&#40;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory&#41;, [visual attention]&#40;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention&#41;, and rule-learning.)

Both my neuroscience and machine learning research have been motivated by an interest in how complex systems and high-dimensional information can be [represented humanely](http://worrydream.com/#!/TheHumaneRepresentationOfThoughtTalk) and communicated meaningfully.

[comment]: <> (This flowed naturally from the process of discovering and mastering techniques for complex data analysis &#40;we mostly just stole from the machine learning community&#41;, and sharing my work with others.)

I'm a contributor to [vissl](https://vissl.ai/), FAIR's library for self-supervised learning.

My other hobbies include organizing [software engineering conferences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_University_Software_Engineering_Conference#CUSEC_2012:_Turing_Complete,_January_19%E2%80%9323,_2012_Montreal,_Quebec), [training](/images/cloe_balancing_rice_cake.jpg) [my](/images/clobertasaurus.jpg) [dog](/images/queenest_bean_of_the_good_girls.jpg), and producing and consuming music and food.
