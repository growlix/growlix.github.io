<!--<p>I published a series of papers during my FAIR residency examining the causal role of selectivity and the state of interpretability research in deep neural networks. The <u><a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=8nl0k08uMi">first paper</a></u>, accepted to <i>ICLR</i> 2021, shows that easily-interpretable neurons in deep neural networks (DNNs) may actually impair DNN function. The <u><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07693">second paper</a></u>, presented at the 2020 <i>ICML Workshop on Uncertainty and Robustness in Deep Learning</i>, examines the effects of easily-interpretable neurons on DNN robustness to adversarial and naturalistic perturbations. The <u><a href="https://ml-retrospectives.github.io/neurips2020/camera_ready/4.pdf">final paper</a></u>, presented at <i>ML Retrospectives, Surveys & Meta-Analyses @NeurIPS 2020</i>, makes a plea for greater rigor in interpretability research. See <u><a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/easy-to-interpret-neurons-may-hinder-learning-in-deep-neural-networks/">this blog post</a></u> for an accessible summary of all three papers.</p>-->
