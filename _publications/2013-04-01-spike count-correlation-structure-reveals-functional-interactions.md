excerpt: "Neurons that process sensory information are often arranged topographically in the cortex. For example, neurons in visual cortex that fire in response to light at a given point in the visual field will lie adjacent on the cortical surface to neurons that respond to light at an adjacent point in the visual field. The connection strength between neurons within a given brain region typically follows this same pattern: neurons that have similar response preferences will be more strongly connected. While this relationship between connection strength, response similarity, and anatomical distance is well-established across different regions of sensory cortex, it is unclear whether it also exists in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). There are two causes for this ambiguity: First, the PFC integrates information from a variety of different sensory modalities and brain regions, and accordingly the response properties of PFC neurons are often much less intuitive and more challenging to characterize than those of neurons in sensory cortex. Second, there are very few studies examining connection strength between PFC neurons, likely because doing so requires a researcher to record from multiple neurons simultaneously, which is methodologically challenging. We leveraged the power of multielectrode arrays, which can record from many neurons simultaneously, to investigate functional connectivity between neurons in the PFC. We found that functional connectivity between PFC area 8a neurons depends on the physical distance between them and the relationship between their visuospatial tuning preferences, similar to what is observed in sensory cortex. Our results support the notion that the relationship between anatomical distance, tuning, and connectivity strength appears to be a general property of cortex.
